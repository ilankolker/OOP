In this project, I developed a simulation that is played without a win or lose condition at this stage. 
The simulator is a procedural simulation that faithfully replicates reality.
The simulation features a day-night cycle, including screen darkness, an avatar character capable of running and jumping,
trees with swaying leaves, and fruits that provide energy to the character. 
This simulation could be further developed in the future to incorporate elements such as water
and rain, potentially evolving into a platformer game, a building game, or a survival game.
This project was a great opportunity to explore procedural simulation and game development concepts,
enhancing my skills in Java programming.
