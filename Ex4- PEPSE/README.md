# Procedural Simulation - PEPSE

This project is a **procedural simulation** developed without a win/lose condition at this stage. The simulation replicates elements of reality, featuring a dynamic environment and character interactions.

## 🌍 Simulation Features

- **Day-Night Cycle**: The screen transitions from day to night, simulating real-world lighting conditions.
- **Character Movement**: An avatar character can run and jump.
- **Trees and Fruits**: Trees with swaying leaves and fruits that provide energy to the character.

## 🚀 Future Development

The simulation could evolve into:
- A **platformer game**.
- A **building game**.
- A **survival game** with additional elements like water and rain.
