In this exercise, I implemented a tournament of Tic-Tac-Toe games.
In our version, the board size is n x n, and a single game round ends 
when a player wins or when there are no empty squares left on the board.
A player is defined as a winner if they achieve a sequence of k marked squares
in a row, column, or diagonal.
