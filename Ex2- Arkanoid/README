I implemented a game called "Bricker," which is similar to the classic game "Arkanoid".
The project involved using the DanoGameLab library as the game engine. 
With this library, I created game objects managed by the engine using the game manager.
The project was divided into two parts: in the first part, I built the basic game,
and in the second part, I added special effects to enhance the gameplay.
