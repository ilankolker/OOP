In this project, I developed software that converts image files into ASCII art.
The program takes three inputs: the path to an image file, a set of ASCII characters to use for the conversion, and the desired resolution for the ASCII art.
It then converts the image into ASCII art and displays the output either as an image on the console or saves it as an HTML file.
I implemented a user interface to make the conversion process user-friendly.
For example, I demonstrated the conversion of an image in two scenarios:
Using the digits 0-9 in ASCII with a resolution of 128 characters per line.
Using all ASCII characters with a resolution of 256 characters per line.
Overall, this project was a great opportunity to work with image processing and ASCII art generation, enhancing my programming skills in Java.
