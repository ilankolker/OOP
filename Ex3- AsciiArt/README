In this project, I developed software that converts image files into ASCII art.
The program takes three inputs: the path to an image file, a set of ASCII characters to use 
for the conversion, and the desired resolution for the ASCII art.
It then converts the image into ASCII art and displays the output either as an image on the
console or saves it as an HTML file.
